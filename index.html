        <h2><span class="border">About Me</span></h2>
        <p>
          I'm a customer service professional discovering their love for
          building things with code.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2015, my boyfriend at the time (now husband) was a frontend web
          developer. I was always asking him questions about how he built that
          and how cool it was. One day he was like why don't you try to learn
          and see if you like it? I learned the basics of web development but
          let it go to the wayside once I started working over 50 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to covid, I had a lot more time at home and wondered what brought
          me joy. I remembered how I felt building websites and tiny apps and
          the joy I got making those. I decided to get out of the house by
          taking a retail job since I didn't to bne stuck at home anymore. Once
          I got used to working there, I got the courage to learn web
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm seeking a full time role where I can contribute my skills both in
          coding and customer service to help a company achieve their goals.
          Interested in getting to know me?

            <h3>Forkify App</h3>
            <p>
              I built this project as a part of the Complete Javascript course
              2024 from Udemy. Users are able to search for recipes and are able
              to add their own. Recipes are from the Forkify API.
            </p>
            <p>
              I really enjoyed that we were working with an API. It was pretty
              cool to see the amount of recipes that would be returned from one
              search. And because of Javascript, all of the information was
              formatted in a user-friendly way on the page.

            <h3>Get it done!</h3>
            <p>
              I chose to build this to do list since I love making lists and
              planning my day. This app helped cement the React fundamentals so
              I can more easily build the next app with more complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since I'm an avid list maker, I also needed to be able to
              differentiate the priority of each task. I added the option to
              prioritize and made them different colors.
            </p>
            <p>I made this using HTML, CSS, and React.</p>

            <h3>Faves library</h3>
            <p>
              I absolutely love to read and because of this, I have a bit of a
              book problem. I'm planning to write a physical library tracker
              that will house all the books that are part of my permanent
              library and how many are in it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since my book-buying is a little bit out of control, I want to be
              able to write some rules that will help me get it under control. I
              plan to make this with React, Google Books API, and supabase.
